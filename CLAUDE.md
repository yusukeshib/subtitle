# Jimaku

Chrome extension (MV3) that translates Amazon Prime Video's English subtitles via Claude and overlays them on the player. Target language is user-selectable from the popup.

## Layout

- `src/background.ts` — service worker; intercepts subtitle network requests, draws the action icon per status, relays badge/icon state per tab
- `src/content.ts` — content script; renders the translated overlay on the player, positioned relative to Prime Video's native caption element
- `src/popup/` — extension popup (status, progress, Generate/Regenerate, language dropdown, toggles)
- `src/options/` — options page (API key, timing offset)
- `src/lib/` — shared modules (cache, translate, subtitle parsers)
- `manifest.config.ts` — MV3 manifest (built via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`)
- `eval/` — offline translation eval harness (see `docs/translation-eval.md`)

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server with HMR (writes dev build to `dist/`)
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist/`
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run lint` / `npm run check` — Biome (check / check --write)
- `npm run chrome` — launches Chrome with `dist/` loaded + remote debugging on port 9222
- `npm run chrome:build` — `build` then `chrome`

## Dev workflow (HMR, no rebuild per change)

CRXJS supports hot-reload. Preferred iteration loop:

1. Run `npm run dev` in one terminal — writes a dev manifest to `dist/` and serves module HMR from `localhost:5173`
2. Load `dist/` as an unpacked extension (once; `npm run chrome` does this with CDP on 9222)
3. Edit `src/content.ts`, `src/popup/*`, or `src/options/*` → **auto-reloads** in the browser, no rebuild needed
4. Edit `src/background.ts` → CRXJS attempts to reload the service worker; if it gets stuck, click Reload on `chrome://extensions` (it's not HMR-friendly)
5. Before pushing, run `npm run build` to confirm a clean prod build (`dist/` is gitignored, so CI builds from source)

`npm run build` vs `npm run dev` both write to `dist/`, so switching between them just requires reloading the extension once.

**Vite CORS gotcha:** Vite 5+ tightened `server.cors` to reject `chrome-extension://` origins by default. `vite.config.ts` explicitly allows them via `server.cors.origin: /chrome-extension:\/\/.+/`. Without it, the extension sees `[CRXJS] Vite Dev Server is not available on http://localhost:5173` with CORS errors in the console.

## Debugging via chrome-devtools MCP

1. Run `npm run chrome:build` (or `npm run chrome` if `dist/` already has a dev/prod build) — Chrome launches with the extension loaded and CDP on `localhost:9222`
2. Use the `chrome-devtools` MCP tools to drive it (`list_pages`, `navigate_page`, `take_snapshot`, `list_console_messages`, `evaluate_script`, etc.)
3. The MCP server attaches to the already-running Chrome; it cannot install an unpacked extension itself
4. The popup is at `chrome-extension://<id>/src/popup/popup.html` — navigate there to inspect it outside of toolbar-click context
