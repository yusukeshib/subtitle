 *     requests and pushes URLs to the content script, which fetches and parses
 *     the file. Used by Prime Video.

/**
 * Abstraction over a streaming platform.
 *
 * The extension is platform-aware in three places:
 *   - Manifest: which hosts we request permission for, which URLs mount the
 *     content script.
 *   - Background: which hosts we watch for subtitle requests, which SPA
 *     navigation events reset tab state, and how to derive a per-title key
 *     so in-episode history-state updates don't wipe translation state.
 *   - Content script: which native caption element to observe / hide, and
 *     how to pull a human-readable title from the DOM.
 *
 * A `Platform` bundles all of that for one service so adding a new service
 * is a single-file change.
